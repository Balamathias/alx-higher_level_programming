# SQL - Introduction

This was my first SQL project At Alx School in which I began to work with SQL and relational databases.This project was mainly about  data definition, data manipulation language, making subqueries, and using functions.

## Usage :dolphin:

* Scripts [3-list_tables.sql](./3-list_tables.sql) forward take the database to query
from as a MySQL command line argument.

```
$ cat 3-list_tables.sql | mysql -h localhost -u root -p mysql
```

* Tasks 101-103 query from the database [temperatures.sql](./temperatures.sql).
